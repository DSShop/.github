<h4 align = "center">DSShop is a 3DS/DSi homebrew application which allows you to download DS Games directly to your 3DS/DSi.</h4><br>
<p align = "center">This project has been created with the preservation of DS Games in mind.<br>
It is not supposed to be a piracy hub and each game on the server has been legally dumped.<br>
Instead it's supposed to be a way for people to play all the rare and obscure DS games without having to waste a bunch of money<br>
We hope that you enjoy our work!<br></p>
